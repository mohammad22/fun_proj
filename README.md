This is the code of [my website](http://ex-mathcompute.herokuapp.com/).
It is a django app. It has the basic features (which at least so far gets the job done for me):

 -- Integrating markdown, mathjax, and code-snippets highlighting for blog posts in django-admin.

 -- Adding images to blog posts in django-admin.

 -- In case you like heroku, it's ready to deploy on heroku (i.e., just set the environment variables, referenced in settings.py, and `git push heroku`. Done).
