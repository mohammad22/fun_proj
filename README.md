This is the code of [my website](http://ex-mathcompute.herokuapp.com/).
It is a django app. It has the basic features (which at least so far gets the job done for me):

 -- Integrating markdown, mathjax, and code-snippets highlighting for blog posts in django-admin.

 -- Adding images to blog posts in django-admin.
